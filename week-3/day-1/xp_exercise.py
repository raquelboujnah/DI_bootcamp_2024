# #exercise 1
# # Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.
# # Outside of the class, create a function that finds the oldest cat and returns the cat.
# # Print the following string: “The oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.”. Use the function previously created.
# class Cat:
#     def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):

# #exercise 2
# # Create a class called Dog.
# # In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
# # Create a method called bark that prints the following string “<dog_name> goes woof!”.
# # Create a method called jump that prints the following string “<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!”. x is the height*2.
# # Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog’s name is “Rex” and his height is 50cm.
# # Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# # Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog’s name is “Teacup” and his height is 20cm.
# # Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# # Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.

#exercise 3
# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object
#Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:
class Song:
    def __init__(self, lyrics = list):
        self.lyrics = lyrics
    
    def sing_me_a_song(self):
        for sentence in self.lyrics:
            print(sentence)

def main():
    stairway= Song(["There's a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she's buying a stairway to heaven"])
    Song.sing_me_a_song(stairway)

#exercise 4
# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isn’t already in the list.
# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
# Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.
# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
# Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.
# Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.
# Tip: The zookeeper is the one who will use this class.
