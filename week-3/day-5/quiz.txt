1. What is a class?
    A class is like a big box who will contain all the function that we need. 
    A class also allow us to creact several unique objects called instance but all connected to the same class.

2. What is an instance?
    An instance will be the object of the class, it will create his own data, you can create how many you want and each one would be unique. 
    For exemple your account on github is an istance and github is the class. The instance can use any function he want in the class

3. What is encapsulation?
    Encapsulation is the first of the four pillars. Encapsulation is a way to build and control the data by using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.

4. What is abstraction?
    Abstraction is the second of the four pillars. Abstraction is here to take the data and store into many places and hide details that are not necessary. 
    It helps for reducing complexity, making it easier to design and understand systems.

5. What is inheritance?
    Inheritance is the third of the four pillars. Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing one called the "superclass". 
    It will be able to use his attribute his methods and all his data. As i was told the super class is the parent and the new class will be the child.

6. What is multiple inheritance?
    Multiple inheritance allow to a class to be derived from more than one superclass.

7. What is polymorphism?
    Polymorphism is the last of the four pillars. Polymorphism is the opposite of multiply inheritance. Polymorphism is a way for a superclass to give his data to many classes, 
    in other word, to have more than one child

8. What is method resolution order or MRO?
    MRO is a concept used in inheritance. It is a way to understand the order the inheritance will take if it's multiple. In Python, the MRO is from bottom to top and left to right
