#exercise 2
# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age.
# if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.

family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


# How much does each family member have to pay ?

# Print out the family’s total cost for the movies.
# Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the provided family variable (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary that is initially empty).

#exercise 3
# Create a dictionary called brand which value is the information from part one (turn the info into keys and values).
# The values type_of_clothes and international_competitors should be a list. The value of major_color should be a dictionary.
# 3. Change the number of stores to 2.
# 4. Print a sentence that explains who Zaras clients are.
# 5. Add a key called country_creation with a value of Spain.
# 6. Check if the key international_competitors is in the dictionary. If it is, add the store Desigual.
# 7. Delete the information about the date of creation.
# 8. Print the last international competitor.
# 9. Print the major clothes colors in the US.
# 10. Print the amount of key value pairs (ie. length of the dictionary).
# 11. Print the keys of the dictionary.
# 12. Create another dictionary called more_on_zara with the following details:
# 13. Use a method to add the information from the dictionary more_on_zara to the dictionary brand.
# 14. Print the value of the key number_stores. What just happened ?
