# exercise 2
# Given a tuple which value is integers, is it possible to add more integers to the tuple?
# No but you can add a tuplle with another tuple to create a new tuple including those two

# exercise 3

# Remove “Banana” from the list.
# Remove “Blueberries” from the list.

# Count how many apples are in the basket.
# Empty the basket.

# Recap – What is a float? What is the difference between an integer and a float?
# Create a list containing the following sequence 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 (don’t hard-code the sequence).

# Ask the user to input their favorite fruit(s) (one or several fruits).
# Hint : Use the built in input method. Ask the user to separate the fruits with a single space, eg. "apple mango cherry".

# Now that we have a list of fruits, ask the user to input a name of any fruit.
